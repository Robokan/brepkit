//! Two booleans whose plane faces were split right but sampled or traced
//! wrong, both read from STEP as a file gives them.
//!
//! A plate whose end is notched round a ring of the notch's radius, its
//! outline B-spline curves and the notch's arc, a hole at its far end,
//! fused with the ring. The plate's faces are untouched but for their
//! edges, and a face's sample point was picked off its outline's chords
//! with the holes left out, then moved clear of the hole on chord polygons
//! again: it landed 3e-3 inside the notch's arc, the face read inside the
//! ring and was dropped.
//!
//! A block with a counterbore cut by a part whose top runs across the
//! counterbore's floor through the bore's axis, a tab standing above it.
//! The floor's walk took the floor's two sides of the tab round the bore as
//! one loop, crossing each section twice, and the floor came out whole.
//!
//! Three more that took the first fixes wrong, each falling back to the mesh
//! boolean: a bored peg cut by a rod, whose end face carries the rod's hole
//! twice (in one parity the copies cancelled, and the face's point landed in
//! the hole); a drum fused into a plate's notch of its own radius, its axis
//! 0.77 off the notch's (its rim's arc in the gap is kept on the plate's
//! sixteen-chord outline, and the fuse depends on it); and a fuse whose
//! section pcurves run against their flags, which other readings expect.
