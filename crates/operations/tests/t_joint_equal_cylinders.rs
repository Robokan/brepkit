//! A T-joint of two equal cylinders: a bar lying across a rod's top, its axis
//! through the rod's axis at the rod's top, so the bar's lower half sits in the
//! rod and the rod's top disc is cut by the bar's wall along a chord.
//!
//! On the rod's wall the section is a pair of half ellipses meeting at the
//! two points where the walls touch, both on the rod's rim. The patch of the
//! wall between them runs rim to rim, has no line in its outline and lies
//! clear of any region it could be a hole of, so it has to be told an outer
//! loop by its winding. Read as a hole, it was dropped with its twin and the
//! boolean fell back to a mesh whenever the bar's seam turned to the side or
//! the bottom.
//!
//! The shared volume is the half Steinmetz solid, 8 r^3 / 3.
